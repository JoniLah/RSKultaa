# RSKultaa
My first created website that's supposed to be simple to use, database-free and easily customizable.
The idea for this page is to sell ingame cash for OldSchool RuneScape for real money. There are loads of websites doing this same task, but this would be only for Finnish people.

This website was originally developed for my friend who wanted to try out if a business like this could achieve any decent profits.
However, seems like he is not interested in this project anymore, so I decided to publish this without Live Chat -functions since it requires (the one I'd use) the website being hosted already.
Also, some of the supposed functions/methods that should've been added to site, are not ready yet (eg. receipt from the purchase emailed to your email).

This project uses mostly Finnish language, so for those who do not understand Finnish, might find it hard to understand this website.
